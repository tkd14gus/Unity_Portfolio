MAST Revision Log:

----------------------------------------------------------
5/31/2020 - Version 1.4
----------------------------------------------------------

- Changes and Additions:

    - In order to accommodate new features, MAST now uses
      tabs for: Build, Paint, Settings, and Tools.
  
    - Added the material painter.  This is on the 2nd tab
      at the top of the MAST window.  It uses the same
      palette interface as the current prefab Placement
      window.
        - The Paint Material tool replaces whatever
          material you click on a GameObject with the one
          selected in the palette.
        - The Restore Material tool reverts any material
          you click on a GameObject back to the original
          prefab material.
        - The Loads Materials icon sets the root folder
          for the materials in the palette.
  
    - Added the folder selection popup "dropdown" above
      the palette.  It will display "All Prefabs" as well
      as every subfolder in the prefab folder you
      selected.  Change the folder and only the prefabs
      in that folder will be shown.  The material painter
      palette also uses this same type of popup.
  
    - Added the assembly creator "kit-bashing" tool.  It
      allows you to create prefabs from selected objects
      in your scene, also allowing you to choose which
      GameObject to use as the anchor.  The anchor will
      be positioned at 0,0,0 when the assembly is saved.
  
    - Redesigned the backend of the prefab palette.  It
      now saves all prefabs in a subfolder inside each
      prefab folder.  It will only create thumbnails for
      new prefabs.  This means that MAST now loads the
      palette much faster and no longer breaks when
      switching scenes.
  
    - The prefab creator can now combine meshes in each
      prefab during creation, or it can "still" preserve
      model hierarchy (parent/child) relationships which
      also keeps the meshes separated.  This option is on
      the last step of the Prefab Creator.
    
    - Hiding the grid now deselects the active draw tool
      and selected prefab, so the unplaced prefab will no
      longer appear in the center of the scene.
    
    - You can now place objects while under the grid.
    

- Bug Fixes:

    - Paint Area Tool:
        - Offsets are now used as defined in Settings or 
          the MAST Prefab Component.
        - Correctly applies Prefab rotation when scaling.
    
    - When using any X/Z Unit Size other than 1, the
      prefab anchor is no longer offset incorrectly from
      the nearest grid position to the mouse pointer.
      Thanks to Face for posting this fix on Discord!
    
    - Fixed Unity layout bug crashes due to serialization
      timing issues.


----------------------------------------------------------
3/22/2020 - Version 1.3
----------------------------------------------------------

- Changes and Additions:

    - Replaced the old prefab creator.  The new creator
      has its own window and breaks the process into
      several steps.  This allows materials to be managed
      before the prefabs are ever created.  Also fixed
      all known bugs in it.  Tested with models in OBJ
      and FBX formats created in several modeling tools.
    
    - Created a grid that doesn't react badly with post
      -processing effects.  The tint can be customized
      in MAST Settings under the GUI tab.
    
    - Removed transparency from the visualizer.  It was
      causing issues with custom shaders.

- Bug Fixes:

    - Paint Area tool
        - Height was incorrectly using the XZ Unit Size.
          Corrected this to use the Y Unit Size.
        - Paint Area x/z was hardcoded to 1f.  Updated
          this to use the XZ Unit Size.
    
    - Placement
        - Prefab link is no longer broken when placing
          prefabs with MAST.  This way, any changes to
          to the main prefab will change all instances
          of that prefab in the scene.
          (Thanks Jushiip for the fix!)
    
    - Hotkeys
        - Hotkeys will no longer be triggered twice or
          more times after going to fullscreen and back.
          This was causing the grid to move by multiple
          units and rotations to skip steps.
          (Thanks DustedHam for the fix!)
    
    - Thumbnail Generation
        - Transparent materials were not being rendered.
          Changed the background to a 25% transparency
          so they show up somewhat and still allow the
          selection background to be visible.
    
    - Merge Meshes tool
        - Now properly combines/merges meshes containing
          submeshes with different materials.  The final
          GameObject contains a single mesh with all
          materials merged.  Anything flagged to exclude
          from the merge will still be added separately.

----------------------------------------------------------
11/8/2019 - Version 1.2
----------------------------------------------------------
- Changes and Additions:

    - Added scaling option (0.5 - 1.0) for MAST GUI
      buttons located in Settings under the GUI tab

    - Added tooltips to Draw Single, Draw Continuous,
      Paint Area, Randomizer, and Eraser

    - Replaced each method that loaded from the selected
      folder, with a folder select dialog window

    - Grid Unit Size has been split into x/z and y, and
      renamed to "XZ Unit Size" and "Y Unit Size"

    - Randomizer Changes:

        - Added "replaceable" to the MAST Component Script
            - Randomly replaces currently selected prefab
              with another in the same category

        - Replaced rotate x, y, and z bools with x, y,
          and z floats
            - Set to zero for no rotation, otherwise it
              will use the value as a rotation factor/step
                - (ie. A value of 45 randomly chooses
                   0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315)

    - Removed custom inspector for MAST prefab component
      scripts
        - It was not allowing the same value to be
          modified over multiple prefabs at the same time
        - Formatted the actual MAST prefab component
          script to have headers and spacing

    - Renamed and rearranged MAST scripts in an attempt
      to apply some logic to a chaotic situation

- Bug Fixes:

    - MAST no longer causes project build errors

    - Palette no longer loses the column count when
      returning from fullscreen or playing

    - Snapshot Camera now pulls back properly to take
      pictures of prefabs without colliders

    - Eraser tool no longer deletes the top parent
      GameObject if the prefab parent contains a collider

----------------------------------------------------------
10/29/2019 - Version 1.1
----------------------------------------------------------
- Changes and Additions:

    - While in Scene view:  Shift + Mouse Scrollwheel
      now cycles through all prefabs in the palette.


- Bug Fixes:

    - Fixed MAST interface persistence/state issues
      when going fullscreen or running the game
        - Prefab palette is now saved to PNG in the
          Mast/etc/temp folder
        - Selected draw tool, selected prefab, and grid
          visibility are saved to a scriptable object

    - Lag issues when going fullscreen or running game
      are greatly reduced.

- Miscellaneous:

    - Category ID added to the MAST Prefab Component
      script to be used in upcoming features.
